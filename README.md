## ‚öôÔ∏è <u>Additional Steps</u>
* Configure your [SSH key](http://kbroman.org/github_tutorial/pages/first_time.html) for GitHub/GitLab/BitBucket
* After installing VSCode using HomeBrew above, [add Code to Path](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/setup/mac) and install extensions listed at bottom of this ReadMe
* Downloads from MacBook App Store:
    * XCode
    * Transporter
    * The Unarchiver
    * iMovie
    * Paint S

## ‚öôÔ∏è <u>XCode Setup</u>
Next make sure [XCode from the MacBook App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/xcode/id497799835?mt=12) is installed and up to date. You may also want to ensure that your MacBook's operating system is up-to-date before installing/updating XCode. Upon installing XCode, there some additional setup required so that React Native can interact with the XCode command line interface toolkit:
1. Launch XCode
2. Go to `Xcode` | `Settings` in the menu bar
3. Go to `Locations` in the preferences window
4. Click the drop down next to `Command Line Tools` and select the version of Xcode you are currently using. There is most likely a set of `Command Line Tools` already selected, but you should re-select the same selection to ensure that it properly engages.

## ‚öôÔ∏è <u>Android Studio Setup</u>
* After installing Android Studio using HomeBrew above, there's some additional setup required:
1. Open Android Studio
2. On the main home screen, click `More Actions` dropdown and select `SDK Manager`
3. Check the box next to `Android SDK Command-line Tools (latest)`
4. Switch to the `SDK Platforms` tab
5. Check the box next to `Android 12L (Sv2)`
6. Check the `Show Package Details` box at the bottom of the screen
7. Under the Android 12L (Sv2) section check the box `Google APIs Intel x86 Atom_64 System Image`
8. Finally, click Apply and then Ok, accept license agreements as needed
After installing everything in the above steps, then make sure the following environment variables are in your `~/.zshrc` file (or `~/.bashrc` file if you use `bash`) ‚Äî **but it's important that you replace "yourUsername" below with your actual laptop's username:**

```
export ANDROID_SDK=/Users/yourUsername/Library/Android/sdk
export ANDROID_SDK_ROOT=/Users/yourUsername/Library/Android/sdk
export ANDROID_HOME=/Users/yourUsername/Library/Android/sdk
export PATH=$PATH:$ANDROID_HOME/emulator
export PATH=$PATH:$ANDROID_HOME/tools
export PATH=$PATH:$ANDROID_HOME/tools/bin
export PATH=$PATH:$ANDROID_HOME/platform-tools
```
